Hi there! I go by Reading, and I'm a tech enthusiast, writer, and web developer. I enjoy watching anime, reading manga, playing video games, and building gunpla in my spare time.

I've loved technology since my early days. I was so in awe of how it all worked that I spent my time reading technical manuals and tinkering with the electronics and computers around me. Not the brightest idea looking back, since I've definitely broken my fair share of tech, but I digress!

I made this blog for two reasons:

 - It's a new project to develop my newly acquired HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
 - I've always wanted to create a blog since I jumped on the internet back in the late 90s.

I loved reading other people's blogs and homepages back then, and I still do to an extent. There just isn't that much of it anymore, unfortunately, thanks to the centralization of the internet. So this is my small part of bringing a small part of that back today, and hopefully more people decide to give blogging a try too!

I'm excited to share my interests with you all, and I hope you'll enjoy reading my blog!
