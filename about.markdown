Hey! I'm Reading I'm a tech-obsessed writer! My hobbies include testing software and hardware, watching anime, playing role-playing games, and building Gunpla kits, with a little reading sprinkled in! Ironic, I know! 

If you're interested in getting in contact with me, the best place to find me and where I'm most active is on Discord.
