Hey! Welcome to my blog! You may be wondering why it's called Re: log. Well, it's a mash-up of reading and blogging! Reading is my username, and we all know what a blog is, right? Clever, eh? 
"Re:" has another meaning; it is a term commonly used in emails to refer to or respond to someone or something.  This blog is all about sharing my thoughts on a variety of topics!

Mostly tech stuff since I'm a huge tech enthusiast and love learning about and tinkering with hardware and software! I'm also a writer, and I've started some original pieces, which I'll hopefully be able to tell you more about it soon!

When I'm not working or doing those two things, I spend my free time mostly gaming, with a preference for RPGs (most notably JRPGs). For example, I adore the Fire Emblem and Pokemon series!
I'm also an avid anime watcher! I mostly watch fantasy or mecha shows, like Gundam and the Fate series. 

As well as a few other things, but those will come in due time. Thanks for reading, and hopefully I will see you soon!
